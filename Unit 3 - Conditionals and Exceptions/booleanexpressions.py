# boolean expressions
# Kinda like a mathmatical
# 14 + 10 = 24      Algebra uses arithmetic operators
# Can only evaluate True or False
# zaddy
# 5 > 10 = False             Boolean Algbra uses comparison operators
# > < >= <= == !=

print(14 + 10) #Algebra
print(5 > 10)  #Boolean Algebra

x = 5          # SET x equal to 5, tell it what to be
print(x == 5)  # GET x equals 5, ask a question

# This is the perfect test question
# what is the difference between = and == ?

print(4 >= 2)           #True
print (1993 == 1993)    #True
print(-90 < -99)        #False
print(10 != 10)         #False
